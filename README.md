# Machine Learning Assignment Projects

This repository contains a collection of assignments and case studies I've completed during the course Applied Machine Learning, demonstrating skills in **Python, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, MLxtend, visualization, EDA, and model development**.  

Each folder contains a self-contained project with a dedicated README and Jupyter Notebook.
